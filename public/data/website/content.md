When I started doing projects for computer science, I wanted to have a local place to show off all of the progress that I have made. Initially, I had it hosted exclusively on GitHub by repositories, but I wanted to have more control of what I could show on the site. I soon realized that I didn't like this solution as it meant that a lot of the features of the projects were only reflected in the README.mds at best. As such, I wanted to develop a site to both serve as my first large scale coding project but also to give me the liberty to show off more of my prior projects.If everything goes well with this website, I want to be able to have some of my projects running on these pages to avoid forcing you to download the repository to test my projects.

# Current Features

- Developed several static pages to convey basic information
- Created a system where all my projects are generated from content in a specific folder and a JSON with the basic information
- Have different themes that the site can switch between using a mode toggle
- Made all project pages use Markdown files to extend what I can show

# Planned Features

- Hosting this website on either using GitHub or Firebase
- Allowing for the contact me to have a unique message input that will be forwarded to my email
- Have my Game Jam games able to run in browser on this site
