When I started doing projects for computer science, I wanted to have a local place to show off all of the progress that I had made. Initially, I had it hosted exclusively on GitHub by repositories, but I wanted more control over what I could show on the site. I soon realized that I was not too fond of this solution as it meant that many of the projects' features were only reflected in the README.md files at best. As such, I wanted to develop a site to both serve as my first large-scale coding project and also give me the liberty to show off more of my prior projects. If everything goes well with this website, I want to be able to have some of my projects running on these pages to avoid forcing you to download the repository to test my projects.

# Current Features

- Developed several static pages to convey basic information

  - [_Home Page_](/../../)

    - Has an introduction to the site with hyperlinks to important sections

    - Includes "work in progress disclaimer" since this will be launched while the site is in Beta

  - [_About Page_](/../../about)

    - Links to other pages referenced above it

    - Has Cards that show relevant classes I have taken

  - [_Contact Page_](/../../contact-me)

    - Links to other pages I have that show my work or other career details (LinkedIn, GitHub, and Itch.io currently)

    - Shows my email (should be redone later to look better)

    - Created a system where all my projects are generated from content in a specific folder and a JSON with the basic information

    - Have different themes that the site can switch between using a mode toggle

    - Made all project pages use Markdown files to extend what I can show

    - Hosting this website Using Github Pages and routing through CloudFlare

# Planned Features

- Create a page to demo all theming colors with ShadCN objects to ensure that the palette is consistent.

- Allowing for the contact me to have a unique message input that will be forwarded to my email

- Have my Game Jam games able to run in the browser on this site
